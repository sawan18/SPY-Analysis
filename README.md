Project for Penn State's DS220 class

This project aims to explore intraday trading patterns in SPY, one of the most popular ETFs tracking the S&P500, to identify which hours show the most volatility and strongest trends. SPY is the most traded ETF in the world with $28.5 billion traded per day on average and even trades 2.6x of Apple stock (State Street). These insights can help traders make better decisions and lead to increased trading profits by timing better entries, optimizing trading windows, and avoiding choppy periods.

As an S&P500 trader myself, I've found trends to repeat through screen time on the charts. I have noticed these trends aligning with what other traders / research say online. However, this project and analyzing the data myself can confirm patterns in my own trading and allow me to explore other potential correlations or even trading edges.
